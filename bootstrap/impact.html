                "Since 2011, Kathleen has been a crucial piece in building and sustaining our team of peer mentors…and training the professional staff team to serve as lead facilitators of week-long peer mentor trainings. I could not see the program where it is today without the guidance and support of Kathleen as both a facilitator and trainer. For our peer mentor team as a facilitator, Kathleen creates such a welcoming and inclusive environment that makes them feel empowered as student leaders. For myself as a trainer, Kathleen's understanding, patience, support, and mentorship has been essential to my growth not only as a facilitator, but as a supervisor and overall human being. She has taught me to be a better listener and speaker, have self-confidence, be inclusive and equitable, and most importantly, be my true self."

                  "Kathleen’s incredibly adaptive, compassionate, and inclusive style engages folks from wherever they are and with whatever they are bringing into the room. Her ability to model authentic, self-aware, accountable leadership encourages all of us as participants to meet her vulnerability with our own. She uses humor and honesty to discuss tough issues that other facilitators might be afraid to open. I trust her as a facilitator and guide implicitly. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Whether she is leading a strategic planning session, facilitating conversation about the differences between "helping, fixing, and serving," or modeling accountable engagement of power, privilege, and oppression dynamics I always leave having grown and feeling much more capable and effective in my ability to complete my job and be a better, more whole person."

                  "As a result of our work with Kathleen, we have a brand new Peer Mentor leadership curriculum and a model program that is already starting to impact the university as a whole. Our student leaders not only believe in social justice but learned to practice social justice as well. The work we accomplished with Kathleen is already creating buzz beyond our department and has the potential to expand to our community partners in the region.

                  Working with Kathleen is always such a pleasure. She not only inspires me to continue to grow as a leader, she also holds me accountable to my goals in a loving, compassionate way that makes me feel confident in my own development. She helped guide our team through exciting, daunting, and challenging discussions and we came through as stronger, more compassionate agents of change, and simply put-- better people."
